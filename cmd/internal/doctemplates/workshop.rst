Shell completion
----------------

The :program:`workshop` CLI ships completion scripts
for Bash, Zsh, and Fish.

.. note::

   When |ws_markup| is installed via snap,
   completion for Bash, Zsh, and Fish is enabled automatically;
   no further configuration is needed for these shells.


To enable completion for the current shell session,
source the script for your shell.

Bash:

.. code-block:: console

   $ source <(workshop completion bash)


Zsh:

.. code-block:: console

   $ source <(workshop completion zsh)


Fish:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop completion fish | source


For per-shell installation that persists across new sessions,
follow the instructions printed by the shell-specific help command.
For example, for Bash:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop completion bash --help


What gets completed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beyond subcommand and flag names,
the :program:`workshop` CLI completes arguments and flag values dynamically:

- Workshop names, filtered by lifecycle status per command;
  for example, :command:`workshop start` lists only *Stopped* workshops,
  while :command:`workshop stop` lists only *Ready* ones.

- Plugs and slots for :command:`workshop connect`
  and :command:`workshop disconnect`:
  the first argument completes available plugs,
  the second completes valid slots for the chosen plug.

- Recent change IDs for :command:`workshop tasks`.
