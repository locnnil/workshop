# Description

# Self-review quick check

 * [ ] Make decisions that cost a lot to reverse explicit in the PR description.
 * [ ] Avoid nested conditions.
 * [ ] Delete dead code and redundant comments.
 * [ ] Normalise symmetries by sticking to doing identical things identically. 
 ```
 // one way to handle errors
 if err := f(); err != nil {
    ...
 }
 
 // one way to handle multiple returns
 val, err := f()
 if err != nil {
    ...
 }
 ...
 ```
 * [ ] Check that coupled code elements, files, and directories are adjacent. For example, test data is stored as close as possible to a test.
 * [ ] Put variable declaration and initialisation together.
 * [ ] Divide large expressions into digestable and self-explanatory ones. Use multiple variables if required.
 * [ ] Put a blank line between two logically different chunks of code.
 * [ ] Follow the [style guide](https://github.com/canonical/workshop/tree/main/docs/contributing.rst#error-messages) for new error messages.
