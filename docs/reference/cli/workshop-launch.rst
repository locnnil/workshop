.. _ref_workshop_launch:

workshop launch
===============

Constructs one or many workshops using their definitions.

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop launch <WORKSHOP>... [OPTIONS]


Synopsis
--------

This command constructs the workshops listed as arguments by going over their
definitions and installing their components.  For each workshop, it:

- Checks the workshop definition and identifies necessary actions
- Retrieves the required components, such as base and SDKs
- Runs SDK setup hooks to initialise the working state
- On success, ties the workshop to the project and starts it

If multiple workshops are listed and an error occurs,
the operation is aborted and no workshops are constructed.


Notes
-----

- Names listed as arguments must match
  respective :code:`name:` values in definitions
- To update an existing workshop, use :ref:`ref_workshop_refresh` instead
- SDKs are installed in alphabetical order


Options
-------

--no-wait

  Return the change ID, don't wait for the operation to finish.


Global options
--------------

-h, --help

  Print the help message for the command.

-p, --project <DIRECTORY>

  Specify the project's directory path.
