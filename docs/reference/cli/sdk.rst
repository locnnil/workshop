Shell completion
----------------

The :program:`sdk` CLI ships completion scripts
for Bash, Zsh, and Fish.

.. note::

   When |ws_markup| is installed via snap,
   completion for Bash, Zsh, and Fish is enabled automatically
   for both :program:`workshop` and :program:`sdk`;
   no further configuration is needed for these shells.


To enable completion for the current shell session,
source the script for your shell.

Bash:

.. code-block:: console

   $ source <(sdk completion bash)


Zsh:

.. code-block:: console

   $ source <(sdk completion zsh)


Fish:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sdk completion fish | source


For per-shell installation that persists across new sessions,
follow the instructions printed by the shell-specific help command.
For example, for Bash:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sdk completion bash --help
