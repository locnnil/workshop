**A tool for defining and handling ephemeral development environments**.

**List your dependencies and components in YAML to define an environment**.
The key pieces of a definition are SDKs,
independent but connectable units of functionality
created by software publishers and available on the SDK Store.
|ws_markup| simplifies experiments with your environment layout.

**It allows you to focus on adding value to your project**.
With |ws_markup|, you can launch a setup
that previously took hours to configure in a few commands,
and be sure that it stays operational.
It assists in issue reproduction,
enables hands-on code reviews,
and turns environment updates into manageable transactions,
reducing the need to battle with your tooling every day.

**For those who build and maintain complex, error-prone workspaces**.
AI/ML, robotics, IoT, EdTech, and similar domains
typically use less-than-trivial project layouts
that depend on multiple Linux distributions or images,
a plethora of SDKs from many vendors,
and a grocery list of libraries and languages.
That's where |ws_markup| thrives.

Project and community
---------------------

|ws_markup| is an emergent project
within the DevEx department here at Canonical;
|sdk_markup| is its sibling project,
aimed at publishers who create and distribute SDKs for |ws_markup|.

At its core, |ws_markup| builds upon Canonical's mature tech.
It uses `LXD`_ as the underlying container technology;
it also follows the tooling paradigm exemplified by
`Snap <https://snapcraft.io/docs/>`_,
and implemented with
`Craft CLI <https://craft-cli.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Talk to us if you have a project in AI/ML, robotics, or any other field
where setting up an environment is a daily or weekly activity
that can easily shave hours off your schedule.
Tell us about the frustrating parts of your journey,
and we'll see what |ws_markup| can do for you.
Let us know if you have an SDK or framework to try with |ws_markup|:
we'll help you get it out there.
