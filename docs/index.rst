**Workshops are secure, fast, and composable development environments
that come agent-ready**.

**Wrap complex, error-prone workspaces
into reliable and reproducible definitions of languages, libraries, and tooling**.
The key pieces of a definition are SDKs:
independent, connectable units of functionality
that publishers package and share on the SDK Store,
and teams can define in their repositories.

**Workshops enable sandboxed experimentation,
turn environment updates into manageable transactions,
and ensure consistent, reproducible environments**.
With |ws_markup|, you can launch a setup
that previously took hours to configure in a few commands
and be sure it will work the same way every time,
or tear it down and start from the last step without worrying about leftover state.

**Agentic engineering, AI/ML, robotics, IoT, EdTech, and similar domains**
typically use less-than-trivial project layouts
that rely on many Ubuntu versions or container images,
a plethora of diverse tools and frameworks,
and a wide range of libraries and languages.
That's where |ws_markup| thrives.

**Built for AI workflows**.
|ws_markup| publishes :ref:`LLM-readable docs <ref_ai_discovery>`,
and ships agentic skills for :ref:`operating workshops <ref_ai_use_workshop_skill>`
and :ref:`scaffolding SDKs <ref_ai_sdk_designer_skill>`.

How this documentation is organized
-----------------------------------

This documentation follows the `Diátaxis documentation framework <https://diataxis.fr/>`_,
organizing content by the type of information users need.
The four sections serve different purposes:

:doc:`Tutorial <tutorial/index>`: Hands-on learning path for new |ws_markup| users,
progressing from basic operations through interface usage to SDK development.

:doc:`How-to guides <how-to/index>`: Step-by-step instructions for specific tasks
like connecting IDEs, managing projects, and troubleshooting issues.

:doc:`Reference <reference/index>`: Technical specifications for CLI commands,
definition file formats, and internal behavior.

:doc:`Explanation <explanation/index>`: In-depth discussion of |ws_markup| architecture,
concepts, and design principles.

Project and community
---------------------

|ws_markup| is an emergent project
within the DevEx department here at Canonical;
|sdk_markup| is its sibling project,
aimed at publishers who create and distribute SDKs for |ws_markup|.

At its core, |ws_markup| builds upon Canonical's mature tech.
It uses `LXD`_ as the underlying container technology;
it also follows the tooling paradigm exemplified by
`Snap <https://snapcraft.io/docs/>`_,
and implemented with
`Craft CLI <https://craft-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
