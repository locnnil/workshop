Workspace
============

**Workspace automates the configuring and management of reproducible development
environments**.

**Use a straightforward YAML to define your development environment**. Workspace
will create a system container, install specified SDKs and packages, and control
its behaviour with life cycle hooks. VS Code, Jupyter Lab and other IDEs can
discover and use your workspace as a work environment. Dispose the environment
when done and keep the host system clean.

**Make the knowledge of your project's dev environments explicit and shared**.
New contributors can start with a single command that launches the required
workspace. It is easier to debug issues in any of the project's supported
environments, perform code reviews or experiment in a separate light-weight
container.

It is common to have a non-trivial project setup with dependencies on particular
Linux distributions, SDKs from multiple publishers, and system and language
packages. Most such projects can organise setup complexity with Workspace.
Examples include AI/ML, Robotics, IoT, EdTech and similar domains.
