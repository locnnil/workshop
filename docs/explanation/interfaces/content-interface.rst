Content interface
=================

The content interface
exposes host file system locations
to individual SDKs
by mounting them inside the workshop
that references these SDKs.


Content interface plug
----------------------

An essential element here is the content interface plug
that is declared in the SDK definition.

.. important::

   An SDK definition, usually named :file:`sdkcraft.yaml`,
   is different from a
   :ref:`workshop definition <exp_workshop_def>`,
   usually named :file:`.workshop.<NAME>.yaml`;
   the former is used to build SDKs with `SDKcraft`_
   and isn't normally needed with |project_markup|,
   whereas the latter is a crucial element of daily |project_markup| activities.

   The following example is provided only to detail how content interface works.


A basic structure includes the name of the plug itself,
the interface (:samp:`content`)
and the intended target path inside the workshop:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: sdkcraft.yaml

   name: go
   title: Go SDK
   base: ubuntu@20.04
   summary: The Go programming language
   description: |
     Go is an open source programming language that enables the production
     of simple, efficient and reliable software at scale.

   plugs:
     mod-cache:
       interface: content
       target: /home/workshop/go/pkg/mod


This definition creates a plug called :samp:`mod-cache`
that does the following:

- Sets its :samp:`interface` type to :samp:`content`,
  which makes it a content interface plug

- Sets the :samp:`target` directory
  to :file:`/home/workshop/go/pkg/mod/`
  *inside the workshop*;
  a directory on the host system
  that |project_markup| designates at run-time
  will be mounted to it

Overall, the intent of this declaration is
to use a directory
(which |project_markup| automatically allocates for the slot)
for persisting the
`module cache <https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-cache>`__
in the host file system
when the workshop stops.


Content interface slot
----------------------

To let SDKs in a workshop access the host file system,
|project_markup| creates a content interface slot,
which multiple content interface plugs can then access.

.. note::

   Currently, content can only be exposed by |project_markup| itself,
   but can't be shared between two workshops directly.


When the SDK is installed
during :command:`workshop launch` and :command:`workshop refresh`,
|project_markup| checks the following for each plug that targets the slot:

- The plug can be installed.

- The plug can be auto-connected
  (for :samp:`content`, it's a yes).

- The :samp:`target` directory already exists in the workshop.

If the plug passes the checks,
it is connected
and a |project_markup|-created directory from the host file system
is mounted to the :samp:`target` directory inside the workshop.
That's where the module cache from our example will end up;
the best part is that it will be preserved between workshop operations such as
:command:`refresh`, :command:`start` and :command:`stop`,
so you can benefit from a pre-populated module cache without doing extra work.


Remounting plugs
----------------

The :command:`workshop remount` command sets a new source directory on the host
for the plug's :samp:`target` inside the workshop.

First, the mount operation is attempted atomically;
this normally succeeds if the new source is either a non-existing directory
or an empty directory on the same file system as the current source.
Otherwise, the remount occurs only if the workshop was previously stopped,
which allows to prevent data corruption.
