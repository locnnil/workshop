    :description: Explanation article on the system architecture and components of
                  Workshop, detailing installation, the workshopd daemon, LXD backend,
                  state management, interface policy, systemd integration, and data
                  architecture with workshop launch processes.

System components
=================

|ws_markup| is designed to run on Linux systems
and is primarily distributed as a `snap <https://snapcraft.io/>`_.
It relies on LXD as its containerization backend
and ZFS for efficient storage management.

|ws_markup|'s distributed architecture
organizes functionality across specialized subsystems,
with each handling specific aspects of workshop lifecycle management
while maintaining clear separation of concerns
and well-defined communication interfaces.

The core subsystems include
the :ref:`workshopd daemon <exp_arch_daemon>` for orchestration,
the :ref:`LXD backend <exp_arch_lxd_backend>` for container management,
the :ref:`state database <exp_arch_state_database>` for transactional jobs,
the :ref:`interface system <exp_arch_interface_system>` for resource sharing,
and :program:`systemd` integration for service lifecycle management.
Storage is handled through the :ref:`ZFS storage component <exp_arch_zfs_storage>`
with metadata persistence via the :ref:`state database <exp_arch_state_database>`.

.. note::

   For a description of how these components interact at runtime,
   see :ref:`exp_arch_runtime_behavior`.


Main components
---------------

.. @artefact workshop (CLI)
.. @artefact workshopd
.. @artefact workshopctl

|ws_markup| installation on your host system includes three primary components:

- The :program:`workshop` :ref:`CLI <exp_arch_cli>`
  serves as the main user interface,
  providing a thin client that translates user commands
  and communicates with :program:`workshopd` through a Unix domain socket.

- The :program:`workshopd` :ref:`daemon <exp_arch_daemon>` runs in the background
  with elevated privileges.
  It manages the full workshop lifecycle
  including container creation,
  SDK installation,
  interface coordination,
  and state persistence through a REST API.

- The :program:`workshopctl` :ref:`tool <exp_arch_workshopctl>` runs inside a workshop
  and has access to a very limited subset of :program:`workshopd`'s REST API
  for service-related and reporting tasks.


The communication architecture between these components uses a layered approach
where the CLI communicates with :program:`workshopd` via Unix domain sockets,
while :program:`workshopd` interfaces with LXD through the latter's native API.


.. _exp_arch_cli:

CLI: :program:`workshop`
------------------------

.. @artefact workshop (CLI)

The :program:`workshop` CLI provides a comprehensive command-line interface
for managing workshops and interacting with :program:`workshopd`.
It is organized into logical command groups
for different aspects of |ws_markup|'s operations:

- Create, update, and delete operations
- Start and stop control
- Exploration and troubleshooting
- Interface connection management
- Workshop utilization
- SDK sketching
- Miscellaneous utilities


For all operations, the CLI communicates with :program:`workshopd` through a REST API
exposed over Unix domain sockets,
using a client library that handles connection management,
error handling, and request-response serialization.
The client supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

For further details,
see :ref:`exp_workshop_cli`.


.. _exp_arch_workshopctl:

Control interface: :program:`workshopctl`
-----------------------------------------

.. @artefact workshopctl

The :program:`workshopctl` tool serves as a secure bridge
between workshop containers and the host system,
sending control and status messages from inside the workshop back to the host.

The tool is typically invoked by SDK hooks;
it operates with the workshop user's permissions (UID 1000)
and communicates with :program:`workshopd`'s :ref:`REST API <exp_arch_api>`
through a dedicated Unix domain socket inside the workshop
at :file:`/var/lib/workshop/run/workshop.socket.untrusted`.

The tool's capabilities are intentionally limited
to minimize security risks.


.. _exp_arch_daemon:

Daemon: :program:`workshopd`
----------------------------

The :program:`workshopd` daemon serves as the central orchestration hub,
coordinating all workshop operations and maintaining system state.

The daemon exposes the primary REST API for CLI and external integrations
while orchestrating :ref:`workshop <exp_workshop_concepts>` lifecycle
through transactional state management.
It coordinates :ref:`interface connections <exp_interface_concepts>`
and policy validation.

Key components within the daemon include:

- the REST API server for handling HTTP requests,

- the state engine as central coordinator,


- the task runner for running tasks according to their dependencies,

- and specialized state managers for workshops, :ref:`SDKs <exp_sdk_concepts>`,
  :ref:`interfaces <exp_arch_interface_system>`, commands, and hooks.


During startup, the daemon initializes state managers,
establishes an LXD connection,
and starts the API server.
It supports graceful shutdown with task completion and state persistence.
Failure modes are handled through degraded mode operation for LXD unavailability
and error detection for connection issues.
The daemon provides :program:`systemd` notification support
and structured logging for telemetry.

Authentication occurs via Unix domain socket credentials.
Privilege separation exists between trusted and untrusted API endpoints.


.. _exp_arch_api:

REST API
~~~~~~~~

.. @artefact API

The :program:`workshopd` daemon exposes a versioned REST API (v1)
over Unix domain sockets for secure local communication with the CLI.
The API provides endpoints for all workshop operations.

Trusted endpoints (require Unix socket credentials):

- Workshop lifecycle operations (:samp:`/v1/projects/<ID>/workshops`)
- SDK management (:samp:`/v1/sdks`)
- Interface connection management (:samp:`/v1/connections`)
- Change tracking and monitoring (:samp:`/v1/changes`)
- Warning and error reporting (:samp:`/v1/warnings`)


Untrusted endpoints (accessible from within workshops):

- Workshop control interface (:samp:`/v1/workshopctl`)


The API implements proper access control
and supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

For data exchange, the API uses JSON with well-defined types
for workshop information, SDK details, and interface connections.


.. _exp_arch_lxd_backend:

LXD backend
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. @artefact workshopd

The :program:`workshopd` daemon maintains a persistent connection to LXD
through its Unix domain socket at :file:`/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/unix.socket`,
managing container operations.

The LXD communication layer handles projects and container lifecycle,
storage management, network configuration,
and device pass-through.

Its responsibilities also include base image management and caching,
providing snapshot and restore capabilities for efficient workshop updates.

.. note::

   The term "project" in relation to |ws_markup|
   can be used in two unrelated senses:

   - LXD projects, identified by their names
     (e.g., :samp:`workshop.john`).
     These are created at :program:`workshopd`'s request
     to provide isolation in LXD.

   - Workshop projects, identified by |ws_markup|-assigned IDs.
     These are user-defined directories (e.g., :samp:`my-workshop`)
     used to organize and manage workshops (e.g., :samp:`my-workshop`).
     They are referenced in CLI commands and API endpoints.


|ws_markup| implements user isolation through LXD's project system,
automatically creating dedicated projects for each user
following the naming pattern :samp:`workshop.<USERNAME>`.
Each user project includes a corresponding layers project
(:samp:`workshop-layers.<USERNAME>`)
used for temporary storage during workshop rebuild operations.


.. _exp_arch_zfs_storage:

ZFS storage
~~~~~~~~~~~

|ws_markup| uses ZFS for its storage needs, managed via LXD;
it requires a minimum pool size of 5 GiB.

The ZFS pool manages container root filesystems, workshop-specific data volumes,
cached base images, and snapshots for efficient workshop updates and rollbacks.
This component provides copy-on-write storage utilization, LZ4 compression,
and quota management,
and is utilized by the :ref:`LXD backend <exp_arch_lxd_backend>` for container operations.





.. _exp_arch_state_database:

State database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :file:`state.json` file is the authoritative database
for workshop metadata, configuration, and operational state.
It enables transactional operations with atomic updates and rollback capabilities.

It uses a model of "changes" (high-level modification to the system state)
and "tasks" (operations with Do/Undo handlers that constitute a change)
to ensure that requests either complete fully or are rolled back.


.. _exp_arch_images:

Images
~~~~~~

|ws_markup| containers are created from base operating system images.
By default, |ws_markup| fetches base images,
such as Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, or Ubuntu 24.04,
from the official
`Ubuntu cloud image repository <https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases>`_.



.. _exp_arch_interface_system:

Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~

This system handles interface connections, enforces security policies,
and also manages the lifecycle of resource connections.

First of all, the interface system validates connections between plugs and slots.
Built-in interface declarations enforcement handles auto- and manual connections.

.. note::

   See
   `mount.go
   <https://github.com/canonical/workshop/blob/main/internal/interfaces/builtin/mount.go#L40>`_
   in |ws_markup| source code for an elaborate example.


Key components include the interface repository
serving as a registry of available interface types,
policy validator for enforcing connection rules and security constraints,
connection manager handling connection establishment and teardown,
and security backends responsible for creating LXD profiles of established interface connections.

For further details,
see :ref:`exp_interface_concepts`.


Network
~~~~~~~

|ws_markup| establishes a dedicated network infrastructure
through the :samp:`workshopbr0` bridge network,
providing isolated networking for workshop containers.

This bridge network includes DNS resolution
configured with the :samp:`workshop` domain.
