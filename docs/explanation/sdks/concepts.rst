   :description: A comprehensive overview of SDK concepts in Workshop, explaining
                 what SDKs are, how they install packages and configure environments,
                 and how they're distributed through an SDK Store with channel-based versioning.

SDK concepts
============

.. @artefact SDK
.. @artefact SDK publisher
.. @artefact SDK Store

With |sdk_markup|, you can package and publish software dependencies
as isolated *SDKs* to be used in a workshop definition by |ws_markup|,
instead of managing them system-wide or through container images.
SDKs encapsulate all required functionality,
keeping installations clean and limiting access to system-level capabilities.
Publishers handle installation and updates for SDKs,
freeing users from maintaining complex image definitions or configurations.

Most SDKs are designed by publishers
and made available via the SDK Store,
but some are specific to a particular project or user.
A single workshop can include multiple SDKs from different sources.
SDKs are distributed through channels similar to
`snap channels <https://snapcraft.io/docs/channels>`_.


.. _exp_sdk_definition:

SDK definition
--------------

.. @artefact SDK definition

An SDK is defined by the SDK publisher;
the definition may look like this:

.. @artefact sdkcraft (CLI)

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/go-sdkcraft.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :caption: sdkcraft.yaml


.. _exp_sdk_hooks:

SDK hooks
---------

.. @artefact SDK
.. @artefact SDK health
.. @artefact SDK hook
.. @artefact restore-state
.. @artefact save-state
.. @artefact setup-base
.. @artefact setup-project

|ws_markup| and |sdk_markup| enable optional lifecycle *hooks*
that control and extend the workshop's internal behavior
to make any framework wrapped as an SDK
compatible with |ws_markup|'s logic;
in particular, the hooks manage the SDK state
and report its health.

Each hook is a shell script with domain-aware actions
that |ws_markup| runs in the workshop
at a particular lifecycle stage
to ensure that the SDK stays functional.
Specific examples include :samp:`setup-base`, :samp:`setup-project`,
:samp:`save-state` and :samp:`restore-state`.

You may see individual hooks mentioned in the output of
:command:`workshop changes` and :command:`workshop tasks`;
understanding the events that trigger them can help you with troubleshooting.

When you define an SDK,
its hooks should be placed in the :file:`hooks/` subdirectory
next to the :ref:`definition <exp_sdk_definition>`;
|sdk_markup| lints them with `ShellCheck <https://www.shellcheck.net/>`_
and packages them along with the :file:`.yaml` file.


.. _exp_workshopctl:

Using :program:`workshopctl` with hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. @artefact workshopd
.. @artefact workshopctl

The :program:`workshopctl` CLI tool allows an SDK
to talk to the :program:`workshopd` daemon.
Under the hood, :program:`workshopctl` uses a socket exposed by the daemon
into the workshop environment.

Overall, the interaction between SDKs and the :program:`workshopd` daemon
focuses on health checks in post-launch or refresh operations.


SDK health, workshop status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. @artefact check-health
.. @artefact workshop status

An SDK can report its health
using the :samp:`workshopctl set-health` subcommand,
which is typically invoked from the :samp:`check-health` hook
when a workshop launches or refreshes.
The command requires a health status.
If it's not :samp:`okay`,
you can also supply an error code with a user-friendly message
to provide further details.

.. @artefact SDK publisher

This command is essential for SDK publishers
to communicate the health status of their SDKs
within the workshop environment.
Then, :program:`workshopd` determines the overall
:ref:`health status <exp_workshop_status>` of a workshop,
such as *Ready*, *Pending* or *Error*;
it depends on the run-time results of the :samp:`check-health` hook:

- *Ready* means success: the hook set SDK health to :samp:`okay`
  and gracefully exited with a zero code.

- *Pending*: The hook set the SDK health to :samp:`waiting`.
  This means it will be retried, one attempt per second.
  If the retries fail 10 times consecutively
  or if 5 seconds pass without :samp:`set-health` being invoked,
  the SDK health is changed to :samp:`error`.

- *Error*: the hook exited with a non-zero code
  or explicitly set SDK health to :samp:`error`.


.. _exp_sdk_state:

SDK state
---------

.. @artefact restore-state
.. @artefact save-state
.. @artefact SDK state

An SDK can store any data specific to it,
such as a model training configuration,
within the workshop.
To enable this,
the SDK publisher implements save and restore :ref:`hooks <exp_sdk_hooks>`
when building the SDK using |sdk_markup|.
Later, |ws_markup| runs these hooks at the appropriate moments
to consistently handle such data, collectively known as *SDK state*.

For example, before changes are applied to the workshop
during :command:`workshop refresh`,
the states of the SDKs are saved
by invoking their :samp:`save-state` hooks.
On success,
they are restored using the :samp:`restore-state` hooks.


SDK platforms
-------------

.. @artefact SDK platforms

Platforms describe where SDKs can be built and installed.
Some SDKs include compiled code,
which only certain families of CPUs will understand.
Others depend on particular versions of software provided by the workshop's base image.

The :samp:`platforms` section of the :ref:`definition <exp_sdk_definition>`
lists the platforms that the SDK supports.
Each build corresponds to one of these platforms.
By default, |sdk_markup| builds SDKs for every possible platform.
This typically means all platforms
with the same CPU architecture as the build machine.

When installing an SDK,
|ws_markup| will check its platform metadata for compatibility.

|ws_markup| and |sdk_markup| follow `Debian's naming scheme <https://www.debian.org/ports/>`_
for CPU architectures.
SDKs that don't ship compiled binaries
can use the :samp:`all` architecture instead.


.. _exp_system_sdk:

System SDK
----------

.. @artefact system SDK

Every workshop contains a special *system SDK*
that exposes system resources through its slots.
It cannot be installed from the SDK Store.
Instead, it is automatically installed first during :command:`workshop launch`
and removed last during :command:`workshop remove`
to ensure internal consistency.

The purpose of the system SDK isn't to add hooks or additional content;
it's only there to uniformly expose host system resources to other SDKs.
As such, it can't be removed by the user.
It's also the only SDK
that can have :ref:`mount interface <exp_mount_interface>` slots on the host.

The uniformity of this approach lies in the fact that system resources
and workshop resources are exposed using the same logic.
You can also define additional plugs and slots for the system SDK,
just as with any other SDK.

.. _exp_sketch_sdk:

Sketch SDK
----------

.. @artefact sketch SDK

The sketch SDK is another special type of SDK.
Like the system SDK, it's unavailable from the SDK Store;
instead, you define it inside the workshop
using the :command:`workshop sketch-sdk` command.
Its purpose is to allow |ws_markup| users
to quickly make changes to a workshop
beside the regular SDKs listed in the :ref:`definition <exp_sdk_definition>`.

Unlike a regular SDK, the sketch SDK:

- doesn't carry any persistent data
- doesn't appear on the definition
- is unique to the workshop where it was created


The sketch SDK can have :ref:`hooks <exp_sdk_hooks>`
and use :ref:`interfaces <exp_interface_concepts>`,
which allows it to interact with other SDKs.
Note that :samp:`sketch` is a reserved name,
and the sketch SDK is always installed last.


.. _exp_try_sdk:

Trying out SDKs
---------------

.. @artefact sdkcraft (CLI)
.. @artefact try SDK

The :command:`sdkcraft try` command allows publishers to test SDKs
before uploading them to the Store.
Once installed in a workshop, these SDKs behave identically to SDKs from the Store.

|sdk_markup| does not install SDKs in a workshop directly;
it simply copies packed SDKs to a directory called the *try area*.
|ws_markup| looks in this directory when installing an SDK with the :samp:`try-` prefix.

The try area has no channels;
only one version of an SDK can be tested at a time.
However, this version can be tested in multiple workshops with different :ref:`bases <exp_base>`.


.. _exp_in_project_sdk:

In-project SDKs
---------------

.. @artefact in-project SDK

An *in-project SDK* resides within your project's :file:`.workshop/` directory.
Unlike regular SDKs, which are published and distributed through the SDK Store,
in-project SDKs are specific to your project
and are version-controlled alongside your project's source code.

You can create an in-project SDK by ejecting a :ref:`sketch SDK <exp_sketch_sdk>`
or by adding one manually,
creating the appropriate directory structure with :file:`sdk.yaml` and hooks.
This approach allows you to customize the workshop
to fit your project's unique requirements,
ensuring that all collaborators use the same environment and dependencies.

They are a good fit when your SDK includes project-specific dependencies,
tools, interface connections, or configurations
that should remain private to the project
and not be published or reused elsewhere.
