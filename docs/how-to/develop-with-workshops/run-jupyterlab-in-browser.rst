How to run JupyterLab in your browser
=====================================

.. @tests made redundant by tests/docs-tutorial/part-3/task.yaml

.. @artefact workshop (container)

This guide explains how to use JupyterLab with Workshop
by running a JupyterLab instance inside your workshop
and accessing it through your browser.

To do that, add the :samp:`jupyter` SDK
and configure a tunnel interface plug for the :samp:`system` SDK:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: workshop.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 4-9

    name: dev
    base: ubuntu@24.04
    sdks:
    - name: system
      plugs:
        jupyter:
          interface: tunnel
          endpoint: 127.0.0.1:8989
    - name: jupyter


Launch the workshop.
After that, JupyterLab will be available in your browser at the plug address,
e.g., http://localhost:8989.
It starts as a user service
with :file:`/project/` as the default working directory to serve from.
You can immediately start using it with any other SDKs you have installed.
