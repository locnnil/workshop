                 instance to a remote workshop.

How to connect your local VS Code to a workshop
===============================================

.. @tests in tests/docs-how-to/connect-vscode/task.yaml

.. @artefact workshop (container)

A local VS Code instance can connect to a remote workshop environment
via the :samp:`vscode-remote` SDK,
giving you the full VS Code experience against |ws_markup|.


Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting, ensure you have these requirements satisfied:

- The `VS Code Remote Development extension pack <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview>`__
  installed in VS Code.


Configure SSH access
--------------------

|ws_markup| generates an OpenSSH configuration
for connecting to launched workshops.
When using the Workshop snap,
include that generated configuration in your host user's
:file:`~/.ssh/config` file.
Replace :samp:`<UID>` with your host user ID,
which you can find with :command:`id -u`:

.. code-block:: text
   :caption: ~/.ssh/config

   Include /var/snap/workshop/current/ssh/<UID>/config


Add the SDK
-----------

Add the :samp:`vscode-remote` SDK to your workshop definition:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: workshop.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   name: dev
   base: ubuntu@24.04
   sdks:
     - name: vscode-remote


Launch the workshop
-------------------

Launch the workshop if it isn't already running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop launch

Then find the workshop hostname:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop info

   name:      dev
   base:      ubuntu@24.04
   project:   ~/my-project
   hostname:  dev.my-project.wp
   ...


Use the hostname from the :command:`workshop info` output
when configuring VS Code.


Connect with VS Code
--------------------

In VS Code, press :guilabel:`F1` to open the command palette,
start typing :guilabel:`Connect to Host`,
then choose the :guilabel:`Remote-SSH` option.
Enter :samp:`workshop@dev.my-project.wp`,
replacing :samp:`dev.my-project.wp`
with the hostname from :command:`workshop info`.
In the terminal prompt, you'll see that the IDE is running inside your workshop.

.. note::

   If you're having trouble finding the :guilabel:`Remote-SSH` option,
   mind that it's enabled by the :samp:`Remote - SSH` extension
   from the extension pack mentioned above.
