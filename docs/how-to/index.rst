How-to guides
=============

These articles
cover the needs and corner cases
that arise when you use |ws_markup| and |sdk_markup|.

moving projects within the file system or using |ws_markup| with Git:

Build SDKs
----------

.. @artefact SDK definition
.. @artefact SDK publisher
.. @artefact SDK Store

To create SDKs for |ws_markup|, SDK publishers use |sdk_markup|.
This tool is installed separately and accepts an SDK definition
to build and publish the SDK in the SDK Store (credentials provided on request):

This section presents a sample SDK layout for `ROS 2 <https://www.ros.org/>`_,
a popular robotics-oriented framework.
The articles discuss the design of a ROS 2-oriented SDK and its practical usage:
