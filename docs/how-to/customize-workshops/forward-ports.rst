                 covering scenarios like exposing services and connecting to remote systems.

How to forward ports with tunneling
===================================

.. @tests made redundant by tests/main/connect/task.yaml

.. @artefact tunnel interface

Port-forwarding in |ws_markup| is done with the *tunnel interface*.
Tunnels pair a *plug* (the listening side) with a *slot* (the service side),
forwarding every connection that reaches the plug address to the slot address.
Three common scenarios cover most day-to-day port-forwarding needs.


Expose workshop services
------------------------

To expose a service running inside a workshop,
add a tunnel slot to the SDK that runs the service
and a matching plug to the :samp:`system` SDK:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: workshop.yaml

   sdks:
     - name: go
       slots:
         caddy:
           interface: tunnel
           endpoint: localhost:8080        # service in the workshop
     - name: system
       plugs:
         caddy:
           interface: tunnel
           endpoint: localhost:8080        # port on the host


Refresh the workshop and start the service,
so the host can reach it at :samp:`localhost:8080`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop refresh


Note that port numbers can be different from each other,
subject to the regular low-port limitations.
Ensure the plug port is free before refreshing,
or the tunnel will fail to activate.

.. note::

   |ws_markup| doesn't resolve hostnames, but supports the aliases
   :samp:`localhost`, :samp:`ip6-localhost`, and :samp:`ip6-loopback`.


Expose the service to your local network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the host plug listens on :samp:`localhost`,
so only the host can reach the service.
To let other machines on the network reach it,
bind the :samp:`system` SDK plug to a non-loopback address
such as :samp:`0.0.0.0` (all host interfaces):

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: workshop.yaml

   sdks:
     - name: go
       slots:
         caddy:
           interface: tunnel
           endpoint: localhost:8080        # service in the workshop
     - name: system
       plugs:
         caddy:
           interface: tunnel
           endpoint: 0.0.0.0:8080          # all host interfaces


A plug on a non-loopback address isn't connected automatically,
for security reasons,
so connect it manually after refreshing:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop refresh
   $ workshop connect web/system:caddy web/go:caddy


Confirm the connection with :command:`workshop connections`
(the :samp:`manual` note marks a hand-made connection):

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop connections --all

     INTERFACE  PLUG              SLOT          NOTES
     ...
     tunnel     web/system:caddy  web/go:caddy  manual


Other machines can now reach the service
at the host's IP address on port :samp:`8080`.

.. note::

   Exposing a service to the network has no built-in authentication,
   so anyone who can reach the host port can use it.
   You may also need to open the port in the host's firewall.


Share host services
-------------------

When a service runs on the host and code inside the workshop needs it,
create the tunnel the other way around:
a slot in the :samp:`system` SDK (the provider)
and a plug in the regular SDK (the consumer).

The example shares the host's PostgreSQL server
(:samp:`localhost:5432`) with MLflow in the workshop:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: workshop.yaml

   sdks:
     - name: mlflow
       plugs:
         postgres:
           interface: tunnel
           endpoint: localhost:5432        # where MLflow will connect
     - name: system
       slots:
         postgres:
           interface: tunnel
           endpoint: localhost:5432        # host PostgreSQL server


Refresh the workshop to pick up the changes:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop refresh


One notable difference is that the
connection validation policies
are more strict when the slot is defined on the host,
so an extra command is needed to connect the plug to the slot:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop connect mlflow/mlflow:postgres mlflow/system:postgres


After this, |ws_markup| validates the endpoints and enables the connection.
MLflow can now reach PostgreSQL at :samp:`localhost:5432`.
The same pattern works for any host-side TCP- or UDP-based service.


Cross-protocol forwarding
-------------------------

Tunnels are not limited to identical protocols on both ends.
Unix domain sockets are often used for local-only daemons.
The tunnel interface lets you bridge them to TCP ports and vice versa.

Why do this?

- Avoid port clashes:
  Listen on a unique Unix path and publish it on an arbitrary TCP port.

- Expose a local service:
  Make a Unix-only daemon visible to tools that only speak TCP.

.. note::

   Only TCP and Unix domain sockets can be bridged across a tunnel.
   UDP is not compatible with Unix domain sockets.


Workshop Unix domain socket to host TCP port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose a gRPC service inside the workshop
listens on :file:`/run/grpc-service.sock` (Unix).
You want to reach it on the host at :samp:`localhost:18080`:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: workshop.yaml

   #...
   sdks:
     - name: grpc-service
       slots:
         api:
           interface: tunnel
           endpoint: /run/grpc-service.sock # Unix domain socket in the workshop
     - name: system
       plugs:
         api:
           interface: tunnel
           endpoint: localhost:18080        # chosen TCP port on the host


After a refresh,
the service will be reachable from the host at :samp:`grpc://localhost:18080`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop refresh
   $ workshop info

     ...
     sdks:
       system:
         tunnels:
           api:
             from:  127.0.0.1:18080/tcp
             to:    /run/grpc-service.sock
     ...

.. note::

   The tunnel interface expands :envvar:`$HOME` and :envvar:`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
   in socket file paths automatically, but refuses other variables.
   Only user-writable locations are accepted for security reasons.


Host Unix domain socket to workshop TCP port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's invert the flow.
Share a host abstract socket (which exists only in the kernel, not on disk)
with code inside the workshop on TCP port :samp:`9000`.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: workshop.yaml

   #...
   sdks:
     - name: system
       slots:
         bus:
           interface: tunnel
           endpoint: '@bus'            # abstract socket on the host
     - name: client
       plugs:
         bus:
           interface: tunnel
           endpoint: localhost:9000    # TCP port inside workshop


After :command:`workshop refresh` and :command:`workshop connect`,
the code in the workshop can connect to :samp:`localhost:9000`,
and |ws_markup| forwards the traffic to the host's abstract socket :samp:`@bus`.

.. note::

   Abstract sockets avoid filesystem permissions and name collisions.
   They are written as :samp:`@name` (note the leading "@").


Troubleshooting
---------------

- TCP to Unix bridging is supported, while UDP to Unix is not.

- Ports below 1024 (privileged ports) may be rejected on the host side.

- Ensure the slot socket addresses exist and can be accessed by the |ws_markup| user;
  plug sockets are created by |ws_markup| so they shouldn't be already occupied.

- The tunnel won't activate if either side's endpoint is invalid;
  see error messages and :command:`workshop tasks` for hints.
